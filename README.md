# 🏏 IPL Cricket Analytics Project

A PySpark-based IPL Cricket Analytics project that processes ball-by-ball, match, player, and team datasets to uncover key insights and trends. This project uses **Spark SQL transformations**, **statistical analysis**, and **visualizations** with **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to explore batting, bowling, toss impact, venues, and season-wise performance.

## 📂 Datasets

This project uses **five key IPL datasets**:

1. **Ball-by-Ball Dataset**  
   - Contains data for every delivery in IPL matches.  
   - Used for analyzing **player performance**, **high-impact balls**, and **wicket patterns**.

2. **Match Dataset**  
   - Contains match-level information.  
   - Used for **season-wise trends**, **venue analysis**, and **toss & match outcomes**.

3. **Player Dataset**  
   - Contains player information.   
   - Used for **player performance analysis**, **role-specific stats**, and **top performers**.

4. **Team Dataset**  
   - Contains IPL team details.   
   - Used for **team-based performance**, **home advantage analysis**, and **win statistics**.

5. **Player-match Dataset**  
   - Contains information about stadiums.  
   - Used for **venue impact analysis** and **high-scoring ground trends**.
